# IMBD_CLONE
This app is a small, standalone web application designed to mimic some of the functionality of the popular Internet Movie Database (IMDB) website. The app is built using only vanilla JavaScript, meaning that no third-party libraries or frameworks were used in its construction.

Getting Started:
To use the app, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. This will load the main page of the app, where you can browse movies, search for specific titles, and add new movies to the database.

Features:

Browse movies - The app displays a list of all movies currently in the database, along with their posters, titles, and ratings.

Search for movies - You can search for specific movies by entering a keyword into the search bar. The app will display all movies whose titles contain the keyword.

Add new movies - You can add new movies to the database by clicking on the "Add Movie" button on the main page. This will open a new form where you can enter the details of the new movie, including its title, poster, and rating.

Delete movies - You can delete any movie from the database by clicking on the "Delete" button next to the movie in the list of all movies.

Technologies:
The Mini IMDB Clone app was built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. No third-party libraries or frameworks were used in its construction.
